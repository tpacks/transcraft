# TransCraft
A 1.12.2 Modpack with Farming and Exploration.

## Description
This will be a pack loosely based upon Nature's Beauty with mods I like. The emphasis will be Farming and Exploration. Featuring mods like Pam's Harvestcraft, Animania and Rats.

### Not set in stone
None of this repository is set in stone, not even the name. I will be exploring several mods and check how much I can change the default configs to fit the needs of this pack.
Also I want to get the base (mostly QoL mods) as lean as possible. So I will be checking whether anything a mod does, already is or can also be done by anohter mod. I really want to use as little mods as possible making this pack also playable on 'potato' computers.
### LGBTQ Friendly
This pack is LGBTQ Friendly and supports the LGBTQ Community.
